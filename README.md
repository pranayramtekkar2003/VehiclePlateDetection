# VehiclePlateDetection

This repository demonstrates the use of CNN and VGG16 pretrained model for the detection of Vehicle Plates. 

## CNN 
Custom CNN model is used to train a model and then VGG16 architecture for the final application.

A streamlit application for the same is created.

#TO RUN

1. Install the requirements in a custom environment for this project.
   (All the rewuirements are there in requirements.txt file.)
   Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the envioronment terminal.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to save the model weights for the custom dataset.
   Link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection/data
   (Make sure to extract the dataset if used and change the locations inside the notebook)
3. For the streamlit application.Run the command "streamlit run app.py"

    This will make sure that the streamlit application will run
